To find out the real impact of immigration on the wages of the natives, we need to look for changes in migration that are not a direct response to the wages in that city. And even that may not be enough, becau se both current residents and firms also vote with their feet. It could be, for example, that the influx of migra nts drives out so many native workers from the city that wages do not fall for those who stay behind.

To find out the real impact of immigration on the wages of the natives, we need to look for changes in migration that are not a direct response to the wages in that city. And even that may not be enough, becau se both current residents and firms also vote with their feet. It could be, for example, that the influx of migra nts drives out so many native workers from the city that wages do not fall for those who stay behind.

So it's not going to move people's preferences, it might just help people who was going to do it anyway to nudge them to go in that direction.  So that relates to the first question I left unanswered, partly because it's coming now, which is if not financial incentive, then what? What is it that actually drives people? What is in people's-- how come people are not responding to the incentive, and despite the fact that we think it's so strongly the case.

That’ s when it can get violent. Recognizing these patterns has a number of important implications. First, obviously , accusing people of racism or calling them the “deplorables,” as Hillary Clinton famously did, is a terrible idea. It assaults people’ s moral sense of themselves and puts their backs up. They immediately stop listening. Conversely , one can see why calling egregious racists “fine people,” and emphasizing there are bad people  “on both sides,” as President Trump did, is clearly an effective strate gy (however morally reprehensible) to gain popularity , since it makes those who make these remarks feel better about themselves.'},\n",

So instea d of telling participants it was not the right thing to do, or punishing them when they did so, Becoming a Man asked kids from poor neighborhoods to participate in a series of activities, inspired by cognitive behavioral therapy , to help them identify when fighting was the appropriate reaction and when it might not be.

He became a member of parliament and in his spare time while stockbroking, making lots of money and being a member of parliament, he also managed to write some of the seminal texts of early economics. So this is a remarkable man, by any standards, doing everything all at once. And he was, I think, the first really clear expositor of the logic of what has become the standard idea of trade theory.

So tell me a bit about the role of religion and what you might call non rational principles in getting us to this place where impersonal structures and principles can be so dominant. So the first is kind of an anthropological observation is that, you know, if we look at the database of as religions in different societies, many societies have, you know, relatively weak whimsical, you know, they might have a morality like a person, but they look, it looks quite different than the kind of big moralizing gods that we would find in Islam or Christianity and religions like that.

So it's this sort of extra Trump boost from being high on moral parochialism. And then so what we did is we wanted to know if that would replicate for 2020, and that seemed to be the case there, and then we tried to explain the variation.

So higher incomes. So it's kind of a natural experiment because different states in the US crank this on at different times. And because we have the continuous US census, or at least my colleagues at the University of British Columbia do, they can show these long-term effects.

And I guess one thing that makes me wonder about the weight given to Catholicism here is that it would make me think that development in much of Latin American Africa would have been stronger than it's been, particularly around these kinds of institutions and their level of corruption and so on. Because if you just run a search on what countries have very, very high levels of penetration of the Catholic Church, you'll get a lot of countries in Latin America and in Africa.

If the Catholic Church was saying, well, God doesn't want you to do this, China just said, well, we don't want you to do this.

I think about technology as itself a product of cultural evolution. The way social science works, sometimes people want to put technology in its own bin separate from culture, but it's very clear that people learn, if you just go to the smallest scale human societies, people learn how to make the relevant tools from other members of their community.

Well, let me first, I want to finish the other half of your question. So 1950 and looking at East Asia, what you see there is the adoption of a lot of Western civil law. So China ends polygyny, it burns the genealogies, it's trying to destroy its clans, the one child policy, which comes later, that ends all cousins. So if you don't have cousins, you can't have cousin marriage. So they essentially do in a period of about five decades, what the church took 500 years to do in terms of completely altering the family structure.

And this occurred over centuries and actually transformed the church from within. And then the church began developing secular procedures and new law procedures. And these became models which were then used in secular systems, charter towns, developed a network of bishoprics, which is one of the ways we're able to figure this out. We look at how long different regions of Europe were under a particular bishop and then we look at a lot of things, but one is the contemporary psychology. One of the things that emerges from this is a sort of more impersonal institutions that you really understand as helping to explain why some regions have developed in the way they have, why others haven't.

In a book I'm writing now, we actually have data from the complete US patent database showing that nearly all patents are actually combinations of existing technologies. So that seems to be the case.

So that could be related to the economic shocks and stuff and sort of directions of the causal hours there that's causing us some challenges. One, just an obvious trend, we seem to be seeing over the past 100 years, past 50, I think past 20, is the world is getting weirder, right?

I think about technology as itself a product of cultural evolution. The way social science works, sometimes people want to put technology in its own bin separate from culture, but it's very clear that people learn, if you just go to the smallest scale human societies, people learn how to make the relevant tools from other members of their community. This is passed on. If you look at the larger scale societies, people still have to learn how to do whatever engineering, stuff in the factories, making the tools from other people.\"}, 'vectorWeights': None}\n",

Well, let me first, I want to finish the other half of your question. So 1950 and looking at East Asia, what you see there is the adoption of a lot of Western civil law. So China ends polygyny, it burns the genealogies, it's trying to destroy its clans, the one child policy, which comes later, that ends all cousins. So if you don't have cousins, you can't have cousin marriage. So they essentially do in a period of about five decades, what the church took 500 years to do in terms of completely altering the family structure. So they're implementing the marriage and family program that the church implemented, and they have the full power of the Chinese state to do it.

So it looks like economic prosperity measured as light illumination is associated with groups that traditionally had weaker kinship intensity. And our story is that because of the institutions built in Europe are the ones that have expanded around the world, and now dominate, they fit within the kind of psychology and the social structure that goes along with low intensity kinship structure.

But then if you ask the more detailed set of questions, do you trust foreigners? Do you trust people you met for the first time versus people who live around you and you analyze those, they don't look like very trusting.

So I don't think there's really a kind of unilinial thing going on here. I think there's something more complicated going on.
