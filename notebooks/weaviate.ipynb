To find out the real impact of immigration on the wages of the natives, we need to look for changes in migration that are not a direct response to the wages in that city. And even that may not be enough, becau se both current residents and firms also vote with their feet. It could be, for example, that the influx of migra nts drives out so many native workers from the city that wages do not fall for those who stay behind.

Someone in this sort of neighborhood environment could develop a tendency to reflexively push back with violence whenever challenged. So instea d of telling participants it was not the right thing to do, or punishing them when they did so, Becoming a Man asked kids from poor neighborhoods to participate in a series of activities, inspired by cognitive behavioral therapy , to help them identify when fighting was the appropriate reaction and when it might not be. Essentially , they were taught to just take a minute to gauge the environment and assess the proper course of action. Participati on in the program reduced the total number of arrests during the intervention period by about a third,'},\n",

It's in the early 1800s that David Ricardo, who was a stockbroker in London who made a bunch of money. And as was then the practice, he bought himself a seat in the parliament, in effect. He became a member of parliament and in his spare time while stockbroking, making lots of money and being a member of parliament, he also managed to write some of the seminal texts of early economics. So this is a remarkable man, by any standards, doing everything all at once. And he was, I think, the first really clear expositor of the logic of what has become the standard idea of trade theory. So he actually starts-- this is the idea of comparative advantage. It is very much Ricardo's idea.\"},\n",

But then if you ask the more detailed set of questions, do you trust foreigners? Do you trust people you met for the first time versus people who live around you and you analyze those, they don't look like very trusting.

You can't go to people and say, you should fast once a week and do a lot of dances and do a lot of praying and so on. Because ultimately, this maps on to some kind of human synchronicity mechanism is going to help you cooperate. The real lesson I took from the book is that religion, because it gives you a reason to do things that don't themselves have an obvious logical justification, allows you to band together these cooperation mechanisms. It's kind of nothing else does. I mean, you can't be just in a political system.\"}, 'vectorWeights': None}\n",

We can test it in China because so that now the church is out of the picture, but the details of the agricultural systems affect the intensity of these kinship systems. So in rice growing parts of China, you get very intensive clans. We can check that with data on clan genealogies, going back a thousand years. And then we can look and see if that can explain contemporary variation among Han Chinese. So throw out anybody who's not Han, just look at Han Chinese. So get rid of messy variation.

What are three books you would recommend to the audience? Well, let's see. I really like Why Europe by Michael Mitterau, if you wanted to learn more about Europe. I still think everybody should read Jared Diamond's Guns, Germs, and Steel. And I really like this book, A Chosen Few, How Education Shaped Jewish History, because it really emphasizes how early changes in religion of a particular group had big long-term consequences.

So this is the point they are making, which is that business security is, maybe, valuable for businesses. That's maybe why people don't invest in these other countries. It's because they know that the government could take away their business. And so you get this very strong negative relationship between settler mortality and property security.

The story says that one interesting piece of history is that when Europeans travel to colonize countries in the developed-- currently then in the developing world, or whatever the equivalent of it, countries that were weak and could be occupied basically.
